# Project Overview

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced business environment, professionals often face the daunting task of reviewing lengthy and complex contracts to extract critical information such as clauses, financial terms, obligations, compliance issues, and potential risks. This manual process is time-consuming, prone to human error, and can delay important decisions and negotiations. Additionally, the absence of intelligent tools for risk assessment, compliance checks, adaptive learning, and user guidance exacerbates the challenge. There is a pressing need for an efficient method to quickly distill essential details from contracts, identify potential risks, and provide insightful guidanceâ€”all while reducing the risk of overlooking vital information that could have significant legal and financial implications.

## High-Level Vision Statement

Our vision is to revolutionize the contract review process by creating an intelligent, intuitive, and user-centric platform that automates the extraction of key information from contracts. By incorporating advanced functionalities such as risk assessment indicators, compliance checks, adaptive learning, a terminology glossary, and in-app guidance, we aim to provide users with not just data but actionable insights. The platform simplifies and streamlines the contract analysis process into guided steps, enhanced with customizable extraction profiles and options for data export. Users can quickly obtain summaries, verify and edit extracted data, and add contextual insights with ease. Committed to privacy and data security, we focus on handling documents responsibly while building a knowledge base of contract structures and definitions to continuously improve the user experience and empower professionals to make informed decisions faster.

## Process Flow

### Overview

The contract extraction process is divided into several key steps to guide the user smoothly from uploading a contract to receiving a detailed report. The process is enhanced with additional functionalities for a more insightful and customized experience, and now includes feedback loops towards the user interface.

### Step 1: Upload Contract Document and Profile Selection

1. **User Accesses the Platform**: The user navigates to the homepage of the contract extraction site.

2. **Document Upload Interface**: Presented with an intuitive interface enhanced with **in-app guidance and tooltips** to assist with navigation and usage.

3. **Uploading the Document**:
   - Users can upload a contract document in PDF or DOCX format.
   - Supports drag-and-drop functionality and traditional file browsing.

4. **Validation**:
   - The system validates the uploaded file for correct format and size.
   - Prompts the user if the file is invalid.

5. **Customizable Extraction Profiles** **(not now - NEXT VERSION)**:
   - Users select or create a custom extraction profile tailored to their specific needs (e.g., focusing on payment terms, delivery schedules).
   - Profiles can be saved for future use.

### Step 2: Initial Contract Extraction

6. **User Initiates Extraction**:
   - Clicking the "Extract" button begins the process.

7. **Processing Animation**:

8. **Initial Summary Generation**:
   - Backend sends the document text to the OpenAI ChatGPT API, guided by the selected extraction profile.
   - Generates an initial summary (up to 2,500 characters).
   - There should be also an animation that as soon as I get the item from ChatGPT that it adds it into the summary (one at a time with animation)

9. **Display Initial Summary**:
   - System displays the initial summary with key terms linked to the **terminology glossary**.

### Step 3: Detailed Extraction Interface with Risk and Compliance Indicators

```

**Explanation:**

In the updated process flow diagram, I've added nodes and flows to represent the feedback loop towards the user interface:

- **W --> X[Feedback Reflected in User Interface]**: Shows that the system learns from user input, and the feedback is reflected back into the user interface.
  
- **AE --> AF[Feedback Loop to User Interface]**: Indicates that after logs are saved for review, the feedback loop continues towards the user interface for continuous improvement.

By including these nodes and flows, the diagram now accurately represents the feedback mechanisms and how they impact the user interface.
